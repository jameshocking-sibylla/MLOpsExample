# Managing ML Models in Production

Demonstration of how a model can be created, saved, and updated, and all in production.

## Project Aim

Demonstrate techniques to:

- Create ML model.
- Persist with a model registry.
- Restore from model registry and use for inference.
- Update model in registry.
- Promote model in production.

## Project Background

The business requires reliable use of machine learning.  They are aware that as data changes, so does the need to update the machine learning model.

They want reassurance that we can update a model and promote to production, and without or the minimal amount of downtime.

## Project Benefits

- Demonstrate that with proper MLOps processes and practices, we can manage ML in production to support their business goals.

## Project Objectives

Demonstate effective ML Ops processes and practices.

## Project Scope

- Use dummy data to demonstrate the creation of an ML model.
- Use the model for inference.
- Demonstrate that the model can be saved in a repository.
- Demonstrate that the model can be updated.
- Demonstrate that the new model can be promoted to production.
- Demonstrate that the above can be achieved with minimal to no downtime.

### Organizational Context

The project is sponsored by the CMO and Managing Director.

### Project Will Include

- This is a proof-of-concept only.
- Databricks will be used as the development platform.

### Project Will Not Include
